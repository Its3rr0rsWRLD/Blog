I have also found a big exploit with the ports on windows 11 and 10 so I'm making a fix for it. I made a worm that will spread through outlook that fixes the exploit then reboots the pc. It is being deployed now. Over 10,000 pc have been fixed.


I am not really a hacker but I am kind of like a white hat hacker... without the hacker part lol.
